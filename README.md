# RubiksCubeControlWpf

This project features a WPF control that presents a unique 2D visualization of a Rubik's Cube and how the colored faces move in relation to one another for all the various moves one can perform on a Rubik's cube.

One of the advantages of this visualization is you can see all the the faces of the cube at once, including the three back faces that face away from you and are occluded as a result of it being a 3-dimensional object.
